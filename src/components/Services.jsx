          In simple words, services are just ordinary classes which will contain
          functions of your own choice, so call them how you like. ðŸ’¡ Let's dig
          in! ðŸš€ We will start with fresh React application.
        </p>
        <p>
          React. js is UI library to render and organize UI components. When it
          comes to services that can help us add additional functionalities then
          we should create collections of functions, functional objects or
          classes.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
